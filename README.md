# Switch Control Demo: Low Side vs High Side

An interactive educational tool demonstrating the differences between low side and high side switch control in electrical circuits.

## Overview

This interactive web application helps students understand the fundamental concepts of switch control in electrical circuits. By visualizing both low side and high side switching configurations, students can observe how the placement of the electronic switch affects circuit operation.

## Features

- **Interactive Circuit Visualization**: Toggle switches to see real-time changes in circuit behavior
- **Visual Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of low side and high side switch configurations
- **Educational Content**: Comprehensive information on advantages, disadvantages, and real-world applications
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout works on desktop and mobile devices

## Educational Purpose

This demo is designed for:
- Electrical engineering courses
- Automotive technology education
- Basic electronics instruction
- Technical training programs

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Low Side Switch Control**:
   - Switch placed between load and ground
   - Inverted logic (0 = ON, 1 = OFF)
   - Simpler implementation with lower cost

2. **High Side Switch Control**:
   - Switch placed between power source and load
   - Direct logic (1 = ON, 0 = OFF)
   - Better isolation and protection

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Circuit complexity differences
   - Cost considerations
   - Load isolation capabilities
   - Application-specific advantages

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation or special software required.
